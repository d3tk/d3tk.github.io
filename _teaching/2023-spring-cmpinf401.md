Course Description:
This is an intermediate programming course that focuses on programming via an object-oriented paradigm. Students entering CMPINF 0401 are expected to have some previous concepts and then focus on object-oriented programming, including classes, encapsulation and abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and interfaces. Some introductory data structures and algorithms will also be covered in this course.This class is a programming-intensive course, and students will be expected to complete several non-trivial programming projects throughout the term.
