My name is Declan Kutscher and I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, where I worked with [Dr. Xiaowei Jia](https://sites.pitt.edu/~xiaowei/) on machine learning for climate and environmental systems. My thesis was on the effectiveness of in-domain pre-training for remote sensing tasks. I currently work as a Research Engineer with the [Dr. Trevor Darrell's group](https://darrellgroup.github.io/) at UC Berkeley (BAIR) with [Dr. Ritwik Gupta](https://ritwikgupta.me/) and as a Visiting Student Researcher in the [NeruoAgents Lab](https://anayebi.github.io/group/) at Carnegie Mellon University led by [Dr. Aran Nayebi](https://anayebi.github.io/).

My research focuses on building machine learning systems that operate reliably in complex, real-world scientific settings. I work on computer vision, remote sensing, and self-supervised learning, with recent projects spanning long-sequence vision models, physics-guided graph learning, and world-model based reinforcement learning for intrinsic skill discovery. Broadly, I am interested in developing self-supervised paradigms inspired by biological learning that improve adaptability, data efficiency, and generalization in scientific domains.

Outside of research I enjoy backpacking, film, music, and cats.

Feel free to contact me at dtk28 ‘at’ pitt ‘dot’ edu. I am always open to new collaborations.
