My name is Declan Kutscher, and I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Xiaowei Jia](https://sites.pitt.edu/~xiaowei/). My research centers on developing machine learning techniques tailored for real-world applications in climate science and ecological monitoring, with a focus on computer vision, remote sensing, and self-supervised learning.  

My future research aims to develope self-supervised learning paradigms inspired by the human visual learning system, emphasizing adaptability and sample efficiency. I intend to apply these advanced models to address critical, yet underserved, challenges in remote sensing and climate science.

Outside of research I enjoy backpacking (most recently in Teton national park and Iceland), film, music and cats!

Feel free to contact me at dtk28 ‘at’ pitt ‘dot’ edu. I am always open to new opportunities for research and collaboration.
