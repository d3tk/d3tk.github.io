My name is Declan Kutscher and I am a Master’s student at the University of Pittsburgh advised by Prof. [Xiaowei Jia](https://sites.pitt.edu/~xiaowei/). My research focuses on machine learning for real-world climate and ecological systems, with an emphasis on computer vision, remote sensing, and self-supervised learning. I am particularly interested in building adaptive vision systems that generalize across domains and data modalities. My master’s thesis topic is analyzing the newest computer vision models and backbones in their applications/adaptability to the domain of remote sensing. Computer vision research focuses on the most popular benchmarks; however, remote sensing has unique challenges of scale changes, noise, and frequent domain changes that should be addressed.

My research goals are to incorporate physical and neurological knowledge to achieve human-level efficiency in learning especially with self-supervised learning in computer vision. Significant advances in ML and AI have been achieved via the integration of cognitive sciences into ML and AI and I believe this trend will continue. I am particular interested in applying models to the unique challenges of climate science and remote sensing.

Feel free to contact me at dtk28 ‘at’ pitt ‘dot’ edu. I am always open to new opportunities for research and collaboration.
