My name is Declan Kutscher and I currently work as a **Research Engineer** with [Dr. Trevor Darrell's group](https://darrellgroup.github.io/) at UC Berkeley (BAIR) with [Dr. Ritwik Gupta](https://ritwikgupta.me/), and as a **Visiting Student Researcher** in the [NeuroAgents Lab](https://anayebi.github.io/group/) at Carnegie Mellon University led by [Dr. Aran Nayebi](https://anayebi.github.io/).

I previusly completed my **M.S. in Computer Science** at the University of Pittsburgh, where I work with [Dr. Xiaowei Jia](https://sites.pitt.edu/~xiaowei/) on **machine learning for climate and environmental systems**. My thesis examined the effectiveness of **in-domain pretraining for remote sensing** tasks.

My research focuses on **self-supervised systems** that allocate computation and representation adaptively for the real-world. I work on **computer vision, remote sensing, and reinforcement learning**, with recent projects in **physics-guided graph learning**, **long-sequence vision models**, and **world-model based skill discovery**.

I am especially interested in **attention and perception strategies** that improve **efficiency, robustness, and generalization** for **climate, disaster response, and embodied intelligence** applications.

Outside of research I enjoy [backpacking](/photos/), film, music, and cats.

Feel free to contact me at **declank @ berkeley.edu**. I am always open to new collaborations.
