My name is Declan Kutscher and I am a Master's student at the University of Pittsburgh. I currently do machine learning research with [Xiaowei Jia](https://sites.pitt.edu/~xiaowei/) where I am focused on solving real-world problems in climate and ecological systems. I am interested in computer vision, remote sensing, and self-supervised learning. My master’s thesis topic is analyzing the newest computer vision models and backbones in their applications/adaptability to the domain of remote sensing. Computer vision research focuses on the most popular benchmarks; however, remote sensing has unique challenges of scale changes, noise, and frequent domain changes that should be addressed.

The works that inspired my aspirations include:

- Yann Lecun's [JEPA](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) paper
- Mahmoud Assran's [I-JEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08243) paper
- Xiaowei Jia's [PGRNN](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611975673.63) paper
- Ritwik Gupta's [xBD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09296) paper
- [x-View3-SAR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00897) challenge

Feel free to contact me at dtk28 ‘at’ pitt ‘dot’ edu. I am always open to new opportunities for research and collaboration.
